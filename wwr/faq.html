            <section class="question">
                
                <p>All right, Adam, let's bring you onto the floor and I'll try to help you out.

                    Hello? Can you hear me, Adam? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? I can, yes. How? How can I try to be helpful? Uh, okay, cool. So my first time here. So my current situation following the format is that I know I need to complete this program and, uh, get my processes in order and get things sorted. Uh, I want to complete the program, get it all done.
                    
                    Uh, cuz I have this holiday coming up in Europe in about five and a half months. But for whatever reason, my day today gets in ahead of me. I just. I don't know. It's some kind of like psychological roadblock. How can I remove this psychological roadblock, Jamie, how can I get past this and, and whip my own ass to get it done?
                    
                    I would, I've got one idea, but mm-hmm. Before I kind of expand on that, is it a time constraint or a energy constraint if you had to choose one? I think time. Okay. Okay. So I usually see that the time I spend earlier in the afternoon or early in the morning, of course, is more. Productive. And something I try to do, or at least in the last few months, is I tried to head to sleep a little bit earlier.
                    
                    Even if things are not complex, I know that it will be easier than, you know, next time I'm up. So a suggestion would be to possibly rejig your schedule, um, to make the days somewhat shorter so you have more energy in the early. Hours and then hopefully if it comes down to, you know, Saturday or Sunday, maybe putting some time into the program.
                    
                    Then, although I would also be curious to clarify which components of the program you need currently. So if I had to hone in on a single training module, I think you've already. Gone for it, but it would be six point in iron. In terms of the force sabbatical, yes, I would be going through that, uh, through that actual, uh, through say the actual.
                    
                    Process template under that and just cross checking each of those, um, in there as opposed to trying to go for the whole training. Just ensure that all of those components are met. So for example, okay, 6.9, share my screen. Gimme one moment. I'll show you here as well. Adam is essentially, I would be going for each of these so you.
                    
                    Each of these will take you to their own training module. So just sort of ensuring that you are going for each of these, I think this will help you out primarily, um, as opposed to trying to get through the whole like program instead. Okay. So then to ask, it would be a blend of trying to reorganize your time.
                    
                    Energy, uh, and then kind of clearing the plate so that you would have hopefully half a day to then go through that. And then alongside that, ensuring that the time you have inside the program is then also being spent correctly too. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I do find actually when I first started the program, I was, uh, pretty productive in the morning and then, um, you know, got busy.
                    
                    Just wanna sleep in in the morning. So I think maybe, uh, yeah, you're right. Revisiting that, going a bit a bit earlier, um, getting up and, but probably planning, you know, the next day, the day before. I think it's one of the early training things as well, so making sure that's in place, so, yeah. Okay. Yep.
                    
                    Alright. I, I'll refocus, uh, using that, uh, strategy. Sounds good. And the other thing as well is that, how long are you touring for on your trip? Seven weeks. Okay, so I would just review the projects and the clients that you'll be needing to handle during that time and trying to correct the processes just to handle those as opposed to keep trying to grow the company as you are traveling too.
                    
                    Yeah, I think that's fair. Um, to be fair, like Bookkeeping's pretty sort of repetitive. That's the business I've got and so. For the most, like for seven weeks, they're gonna need to sort of, you know, touch most of the clients, I think. And uh, yeah. But I will actually go through and do, um, you know, focus on those clients and just, just get the standard processes done.
                    
                    Sounds good. Cool. Hmm. Anything else I can try to help out with? I think that's it. I'll definitely probably be back next week, uh, with another question. So, uh, I'll focus on that this week. Yes. Come back and let you know how it went. And please do ask another question. Cool. Thank you. Thank you.
                    
                    All right, Ian. Looks like you are up next. Let me send you a invite to hop onto the call.
                    
                    Hello? Hello. How's, how's it all doing, Ian? Pretty good. Yeah. How are you? Good, good. How can I try out to be helpful? Yeah, so, um, I just finished, similar to what Adam was saying, the first, I only signed up a couple of weeks ago, as you know, but it was a bit slow to get up and running. But I, I kind of set an hour.
                    
                    Aside a couple, two hours aside, a couple of mornings a week. Uh, and I'm getting through the, the lessons a little bit quicker and I'm just on the cause and effect one at the moment, which was very relevant for, uh, what we're trying to implement in the office. Um, so I suppose the current situation is, um, I'm trying to get, we have an SEO process and we have a PPC process that we're, I'm going to improve anyway, but.
                    
                    I suppose the, the current situation around a process for a design, graphic design and little bit of inbound marketing, landing page design, stuff like that. Is a harder one to implement? Probably because it's, I suppose design is more subjective and our head of, you mentioned in the cause and effect tutorial, you know, Contraline Superstar team members, our head of design in our office here in Dublin is finding it very hard to, to delegate work to our remote team.
                    
                    Uh, so. Yeah, so look, ideally he's kind of saying he is too busy and he is too many emails coming through and he has to do all these designs and landing page designs, and they're at the other end. The remote team are saying they don't have enough work to do. So it's fairly obvious what the problem is, but, um, so I'm just wondering to put a process in place with him, with the, you know, our head of graphic design here in Dublin.
                    
                    Do I need to sit down with him and tell him exactly? What I want to do or what we want to do and why we want to do it and get his input, um, on creating a process document and creating design templates. Um, just wondering what your thoughts on that are. Hmm. So before I jump into that, you said that he's also handling emails as well and other duties.
                    
                    Between the jobs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He is, he's, he's kind of a, he's, well, he's, he's the pod leader for his pod, so he'd be kind of a point of contact, kind of day to day point of contact for, for clients in his pod as well. Understood. So before we jump into that, I would be looking at one of two scenarios.
                    
                    Scenario A is that we try to remove everything that is not graphic design off of his plate. This will increase his own capacity so that you won't need his team to help him on the graphic design component. Hopefully. So that means that, you know, instead we would be trying to create a process around emails, communication, uh, team trainings.
                    
                    Everything that is not related to graphic design, that's usually easier. Um, the problem in that is that it's a short term solution because we're gonna free up his own capacity in doing that, and it's probably gonna get reached again at some point. Um, so that's one solution that is usually easier. So I would look at that.
                    
                    If that's not achievable, uh, or say if he is not putting a lot of time into client, you know, uh, client, you know, duties, I would be suggesting that possibly yourself or here, let me share my screen again.
                    
                    Be looking at briefly, and this might be helpful just to possibly. Jump ahead in to four point 12 and uh, and I will probably start here and see if this is a good solution. And then if not, I will be possibly looking at four point 11 two as well. Each of these are reasonably simple process templates except they try to accept, they try to, how do you say it, account for.
                    
                    Activity and complexity at the front end. So I think look at four point 12, see if that template would suit him and, and then his sort of duties. And then alongside that, if it's not heavy duty enough, I would probably suggest four point 11 two. Um, although. Ideally we can try to increase his own capacity because I'm sure he would prefer to only be doing graphic design.
                    
                    Is that correct? To assume? Yeah. He, he's actually, he's actually leaning more towards client communications. Uh Okay. He's starting to enjoy, and I've started to bring him out to visit a couple of clients as well. Um, good. So, yeah, I'm trying to get, trying to get him to be the point of contact instead of them ringing me, obviously.
                    
                    Okay. So it sounds like there's some incentive for him and this kind of interests him. So I would be looking at four point 12 4, 4 point 12, and four point,
                    
                    as I said. Yeah. And then let me know your thoughts on those after you go through those two. And then from a design point of view, we need to try to reduce the complexity of the designs as well. Are these mainly graphic design jobs or can you gimme a few examples of the Yeah, they're, they're, uh, there'd be, still be, yeah, graphic.
                    
                    There'd be social media posts, email. Okay. Emailed, uh, campaigns, landing page design, that, that sort of thing. Um, the odd kind of flyer or poster or something like that. I did say to him again yesterday that we need a, you know, a set template for, for each client where we use, he uses Photoshop, but we generally use Canvas.
                    
                    So we, we started creating kind of brand templates for each client in Canvas. So whether it's him working on it or one of the remote guys that, you know, it's, it's to a template. Yep. Okay, cool. Let me know your forklift after four point 12 and four point over, and of course, um, ideally for each client you would.
                    
                    Between five and 10 examples of each social media, uh, post, if that be something square, something for email, something for, you know, Instagram. Mm-hmm. Um, and then it should be reasonably easy to slot out the content and change the images and. Positioning. Yeah. So in that instance, he should only be creating the initial 10 templates and then in that you should be able to get at least almost a hundred probably out of that as long as they're able to, you know, change out the content, images, placement colors.
                    
                    Yeah. So on. Yeah. Cool. Well thanks. Awesome. Anything else I can try to help out? Um, yeah, I suppose just really quickly on the onboarding there as well, I raised it a couple of days ago as well, and, uh, we are trying to get a, a better process in place for that. Um, so do I have any questions on that? Um, no, we're just, I do, do you, do you, do you use anything in particular to send.
                    
                    Clients a contract, like I'm looking at DocuSign and, and within the, within the client contract, I'm gonna start adding in, uh, fields where they can send their website logins and URLs or, you know, accesses on the contract. So it's just one, 1.1. Uh, interesting. Yeah, I haven't tried that. Um, does it need to be on the contact?
                    
                    Because that sounds reasonably complex from a automation point of view. Does it, um, well, not complex, but it sounds like things could go, could go wrong, so I always like to reduce that chance of that happening. Yeah, no, it doesn't need to be. I'm just, just thinking send them the contract and we get the contract and all the logins back on one document.
                    
                    Mm. I would instead have a form process, something like what I showed in that, in the other training. Uh, but essentially I would have a clip of you welcoming the client, a questionnaire underneath, and then as a processor I would then send them the contract, and then after that I would have another. Survey in terms of all the information, credentials, all of that, um, it seems like a lot upfront, although clients are really enthusiastic at the start of each new project.
                    
                    So I always like to channel that as soon as the client comes in into some new, you know, uh, like even if it's a longer survey, I would break it up into. Information about their company objectives, all of that. And then the contract, and then another survey about the actual project information. So any, you know, any like, you know, uh, intel templates, credentials, so on and so on.
                    
                    Okay. Yeah. See Adam, only because, Yeah. Only because I think if we're doing it in a single step, I think it's gonna take the client longer. I think there's something about having a short, sorry, something about having a long survey that is across, you know, maybe eight or nine pages that kind of feeds into that instant gratification of, you know, like clicking on a form and processing it.
                    
                    Um, yeah. Okay. Yeah, see Adam mentioned content snare there as well, so thanks for that. I'll check that out.
                    
                    Fantastic. Anything else I can try to help out with? That's all for today. Yeah. Thanks for that. Awesome. No worries, Ian. Thank you.
                    
                    All right, Hiko, let me bring you onto the call and we'll try to help.
                    
                    Hello? Can you hear me? Hey, car. Oh, can you, can you, you hear us? Oh, I can't hear you unfortunately. It looks like you can hear me.
                    
                    Still can't hear, unfortunately. Okay. Can you hear me now? There we go. Much better. Hello? Okay. Hello. Can I try to be helpful? Yeah. Uh, so my current situation is that I'm running a couple of basketball clubs. I'm, uh, mostly doing coaching also by myself. And now the situation is that, uh, I, I will use more and more other coaches to do the practices.
                    
                    And we are doing the practices in a way that they are, like a concept practices, so that, uh, they are, uh, made by me. And the coach's job is to do the practice the way that has been pre-planned. And the problem is that, uh, usually coaches have, uh, had a freedom to do practices as whatever they're like in, in that practice.
                    
                    And, and the problem is that even if I give. Uh, the, uh, pre-and practice, uh, we have had situations that coach, uh, uh, improvise and then there is a problem with quality. And, uh, my question is how I sell to idea that pre-concept, a pre-and uh, practice is good for her or him also, and, uh, why he or she should do as planned and not improvise.
                    
                    Uh, it has been like a way to do 20 years. Uh, and this is the question. Okay, so there's a few things I'll probably touch on. The first is that, have you asked them why they're not using your plan, Greg Reston and was their response Yeah. Yeah. Uh, no. I have assumed things, but this good, good point that I should first of course ask.
                    
                    Yeah. Yeah. So I would ask them, because it could be something as easy as they didn't think the plan was that critical, or maybe they didn't see the plan, or maybe someone on the team complained about the plan or maybe someone was. On their team and they couldn't use that plan. So I would try to get cloudy around to why they're not using it, and I would not try to attack them.
                    
                    I would more so come at it from a curiosity point of view, um, and see. And then, yeah, then depending on the response of that, I could give you other directions, uh, that I won't touch on just yet, cuz they won't be helpful. The other thing that I would be curious to know is, are these coaches highly trained?
                    
                    Because in some scenarios it could be helpful to bring in someone who is somewhat junior to coach and just use your own plan, who hasn't got their own plans? Defined, if that makes sense. Yeah, that's so, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Excellent point. Because most of the problems are for the coaches that have, have coached, uh, long before, and, and we don't have a, uh, so much, uh, uh, problems with the new coaches who hasn't had that culture.
                    
                    Yeah. So I would first talk to your current coaches, see what the challenge is. See why they're not using it. Maybe they don't really understand the plan. Maybe it's hard to read, hard to use, hard to, hard to get the team to, uh, use the plan as well. Maybe there was a sort of problem on the team, right? There could be endless, um, endless reasons why.
                    
                    Um, or it could be as simple as, you know, they don't want to use a plan, right? Yeah. Um, and if that is the case, there's nothing. Wrong with them, it's just that they're probably not the right coach for you and your project. And I would be a lot more inclined to suggest using more junior coaches who haven't really coached that often and who would like to learn how to coach for using a predefined plan.
                    
                    Yeah, great points. Yeah. Thank you Jamie. No worries. Anything else? No, this is great for now. Thank you. No worries. Thank you very much for your question.
                    
                    All right, so has anyone else got anything to ask or anything else I could try to help out?
                    
                    All right. All right. This is the final opportunity to ask any questions or ask or any help if you have it. So, or if you need it rather. So if you have a question, please type into the chat box a I'll check in before we, and we were in invite close up. You become hands on call presenter so that you can ask your cool question.
                    
                    And when you do ask it, please, for matter as the. Following format, which is my current situation is,
                    
                    and we'll go ahead and we'll end the hands on call for today. As always, thank you for attending and thank you for your. All right then. That seems to be it for tonight's hands on calls. Then I'll go ahead and then of course, begin to close up the call now. As always, these calls do happen twice per week, seven 30.
                    
                    PM Tuesday, Adelaide time and 8:30 AM Friday Adelaide time as well. You can join up for these inside the actual school community, and these calls will go into all questions are answered for a tax period of up to two hours. Now, if the number of Dream team is online is of course smaller than normal, then of course the call end sooner.
