    <h2>Corey Moses</h2>
    <p>I am from Washington state and it is very beautiful there in the pacific northwest. During the summer I love to go fishing, and do anything that gets me outside</p>
    <p>Currently, I am studying for my degree in Applied Technology BS.</p>
    <p>I was born into the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and am very blessed by the teachings that have guided me through life thus far.</p>
    <p>I think my interest in computers comes from playing video games. Being able to understand what is going on behind the scenes of websites and programs has always interested me, and I am happy to be advancing my skills and knowledge in that field this semester.</p>
