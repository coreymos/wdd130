    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I’m a computer programmer. I make websites and programs. I also make 3D Modeled art. My website provides a
      catalog of 3d models and information about where to buy or download them. Making 3D models takes a lot of time.
      Businesses and hobbyists can save time by using other people’s models in their projects. My website will be a way
      for artists to see examples of 3d art and information regarding those pieces of art.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>I am targeting an audience of people who are digital 3D artists or people or like to view art. People who are
      making their own art and want to find out where to download or buy the models on the site will have access to do
      that. These are people who are most likely on a desktop or laptop. When it comes to the demographic, I would
      assume it would be mostly younger people but not limited to younger people.</p> <!-- change this -->

      As technology continues to advance, the accessibility to different mediums of art continues to also increase.
      Digital three-dimensional art is no exception to this. Blender, a free open-source program which can be used to
      manipulate a three-dimensional space, is gaining popularity in recent years due to its accessibility of being
      free, and also its large catalog of free learning educational tools. All of these things combined have allowed
      artists to express themselves in a new category, digital 3D.
      The purpose of this website is to further increase accessibility by allowing artists to easily find a catalog of
      other artist’s work. One of the cool features of digital art is that you can recycle other artist’s work into your
      own to make your own creative work. Here you can look at and admire other artist’s work from which I have
      handpicked. These pieces of art include links to which you can download the file containing the art pictured.
      3D models are used for all sorts of things in today’s world. These range from specific dimensioned mechanical
      parts, to 3D printable objects, or even objects used in a video game. Look around at the models and explore the
      possibilities of which you can use them for your own purpose. There are countless things you can do with a 3D
      model so if you find something that catches your eye and sparks a lightbulb in your head, don’t hesitate to
      download that model and manifest that idea into reality.

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p>
      Why do I think 3D Art and Models are so fascinating? The imagery movies have been able to accomplish with CGI is amazing. Programs like blender which are accessible to anyone with a decent computer allows for us as human beings to learn the tools to create digital art. I have pursued learning these skills because I want to be able to turn my memories or my imaginations into art pieces on my computer that I can then share with others. Our imaginations and creativity are both beautiful things and being able to actually make those into a real life viewable piece of art is incredible. It allows for you to share the beautiful pictures in our mind.

    <h3>Educational Information</h3>
    <p>
      Where can you learn how to 3D model? I would recommend the software Blender as it is free. As a result of this, a lot of people use the software and make tutorials on youtube for the software. There is a plethora of free educational content all over the internet for this software so in my opinion, it is the best place to start developing skills in 3D modeling. In Blender, you can animate or make images. The only stipulation is that you need a PC that is able to handle computing and calculating all of the different things within the software. For example, there is a lighting system within the software that simulates light in real life. This simulation is intense of the PC and as long as you have a system that can handle that, you are all set to start your journey in 3D modeling. 
      How do you download the content being shown on this website? Well if it is an art image, all you have to do is right click the image and save it. If it is a 3D model, there is a link provided to the website that contains the 3d model and all of its different types of downloadable files. These different file types depend on what program you are using to open the file and manipulate it. The model can be used in a game making software, an animation software, a 3d printing software, etc. So it is important to know your purpose of the model beforehand, in order to know the right file type to download.
