                <h2>Why do I think 3D Art and Models are so fascinating?</h2>
                <p>The imagery movies have been able to accomplish with CGI is amazing. Programs like blender which are
                    accessible to anyone with a decent computer allows for us as human beings to learn the tools to
                    create digital art. I have pursued learning these skills because I want to be able to turn my
                    memories or my imaginations into art pieces on my computer that I can then share with others. Our
                    imaginations and creativity are both beautiful things and being able to actually make those into a
                    real life viewable piece of art is incredible. It allows for you to share the beautiful pictures in
                    our mind.</p>

                <h2>Does it cost money to download these models?</h2>
                <p>On the homepage, click on the images of the models to be directed to a website where you can download
                    the model. Some of these models are free and some of them are not, click on the one you want to find
                    out whether or not it is free.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="question3">
                <h2>How can I learn to make models like these?</h2>
                <p>I recommend using the free 3D modeling and animation software "Blender". As a result of it being
                    free, there are a lot of people who use this program. This means there are also a lot of tutorials
                    online and on youtube that show you how to work your way around the software. This is a great
                    starting point on your path to making your first very own 3D model art.</p>

                <h2>What can you do with 3D models?</h2>
                <p>You can do all kinds of things ranging from animations, to digital art, nft's, games, and so much more.</p>
