                <p>Where can you learn how to 3D model? I would recommend the software Blender as it is free. As a
                    result of this, a lot of people use the software and make tutorials on youtube for the software.
                    There is a plethora of free educational content all over the internet for this software so in my
                    opinion, it is the best place to start developing skills in 3D modeling.</p>

                <p>In Blender, you can animate or make images. The only stipulation is that you need a PC that is able
                    to handle computing and calculating all of the different things within the software. For example,
                    there is a lighting system within the software that simulates light in real life. This simulation is
                    intense of the PC and as long as you have a system that can handle that, you are all set to start
                    your journey in 3D modeling.</p>

                <p>How do you download the content being shown on this website? Well if it is an art image, all you have
                    to do is right click the image and save it. If it is a 3D model, there is a link provided to the
                    website that contains the 3d model and all of its different types of downloadable files. These
                    different file types depend on what program you are using to open the file and manipulate it. The
                    model can be used in a game making software, an animation software, a 3d printing software, etc. So
                    it is important to know your purpose of the model beforehand, in order to know the right file type
                    to download.</p>

                <p>In today's landscape with digital art in forms of nfts becoming more prevalent, it might interest you
                    to know how those things are made, especially the ones that are made in 3D. Tools like Blender pave
                    the way for these artforms and make it easy for anyone to pull scenes from their imagination and
                    manifest them onto the computer screen</p>

                <p>Whether you are just passing by and enjoying the art, or are here to try and learn how to make this
                    kind of art yourself, I thank you for visiting our website and I hope you can find what you came
                    here for.</p>
