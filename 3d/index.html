                <h2>What is this place?</h2>
                <p>As technology continues to advance, the accessibility to different mediums of art continues to also
                    increase. Digital three-dimensional art is no exception to this. Blender, a free open-source program
                    which can be used to manipulate a three-dimensional space, is gaining popularity in recent years due
                    to its accessibility of being free, and also its large catalog of free learning educational tools.
                    All of these things combined have allowed artists to express themselves in a new category, digital
                    3D. The purpose of this website is to further increase accessibility by allowing artists to easily
                    find a catalog of other artist’s work. One of the cool features of digital art is that you can
                    recycle other artist’s work into your own to make your own creative work. Here you can look at and
                    admire other artist’s work from which I have handpicked. These pieces of art include links to which
                    you can download the file containing the art pictured. 3D models are used for all sorts of things in
                    today’s world. These range from specific dimensioned mechanical parts, to 3D printable objects, or
                    even objects used in a video game. Look around at the models and explore the possibilities of which
                    you can use them for your own purpose. There are countless things you can do with a 3D model so if
                    you find something that catches your eye and sparks a lightbulb in your head, don’t hesitate to
                    download that model and manifest that idea into reality.</p>
